# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Verdi!

### A Data Scientist & AI Specialist from Brazil

I began my journey at Banco Mercantil as an intern and, over four years, was promoted to my current position as a Data Scientist. My career is focused on using Artificial Intelligence to protect the financial environment by creating robust solutions for fraud prevention. I am passionate about transforming data into strategic actions, automating processes, and managing projects from start to finish using DevOps practices.

### Featured Experience

#### ðŸš€ **As a Fraud Prevention Data Scientist:**
- I develop and orchestrate autonomous AI agents, creating and training intelligent systems to operate independently and automate complex workflows in the fraud prevention pipeline.
- I create advanced algorithms and predictive models with Machine Learning, which identify and anticipate fraudulent activities in financial transactions (like Pix and wire transfers), enhancing security and analytical precision.
- I manage end-to-end projects autonomously, using DevOps practices to accelerate solution delivery and ensure continuous integration and data governance in MLOps pipelines.

#### â€Ž â€ŽðŸ“Š **As a Data Analyst and in other roles:**
- I led the creation and maintenance of the institution's transaction monitoring system, using Python and Power BI to develop dashboards and apply statistical methods to assign risk scores to operations.
- I automated several processes for my department, which significantly streamlined workflows and increased the team's productivity.
- I served as a Project Consultant, where I collaborated on a market research project for a multinational company. Our work provided critical insights that contributed to a 20% increase in the company's revenue.
